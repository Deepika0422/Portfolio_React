        <p>
          I am Deepika, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong
          foundation in front-end technologies. I enjoy building visually
          appealing and user-friendly websites that solve real-world problems.
          My journey in web development began with curiosity and has grown into
          a deep interest in creating seamless digital experiences. I am always
          eager to learn new skills, collaborate with others, and take on new
          challenges to grow as a developer.
